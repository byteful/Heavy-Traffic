	<LongDescription>
This mods grants you control over how much fake traffic will spawn. 
Fake traffic is cars, boats, trains and planes spawning from an outside connection with a destination set to another outside connection of the same type.
This can be controlled using a percentage change from 100% being the default, vanilla setting, 0% being no traffic and anything above 100% is more traffic.
		
This fake traffic can also be called: outside traffic, dummy traffic, spawner, traffic multiplier, traffic generator, custom traffic, benchmark traffic, intersection tester, interchange tester, outside connections traffic, etc. 
		
Why would you want to change the amount of fake traffic?
- To test your intersections and interchanges with more traffic than the vanilla game provides.
- To test your intersections and interchanges on an empty map, without a city.
- To create unrealistic amount of traffic, like 20, 50 or even 100 lanes full of cars.
- To reduce the amount of traffic to reduce the load on your computer.
- To increase the amount of traffic to make your city feel more alive.
